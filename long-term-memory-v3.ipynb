With nearly 30k users signing up for [LangSmith](http://langchain.com/langsmith?ref=blog.langchain.com) every month, we’re lucky to have front row seats to what’s happening in the industry.\\\\n\\\\nAs [we did last year](https://www.blog.langchain.com/langchain-state-of-ai-2023/), we want to share some product usage patterns that showcase how the AI\\xa0ecosystem and practice of building LLM apps are evolving. As folks have traced, evaluated, and iterated their way around LangSmith, we’ve seen a few notable changes. These include the dramatic rise of open-source model adoption and a shift from predominantly retrieval workflows to AI agent applications with multi-step, agentic workflows.\\\\n\\\\nDive into the stats below to learn exactly what developers are building, testing, and prioritizing.\\\\n\\\\n## **Infrastructure usage**\\\\n\\\\nWith Large Language Models (LLMs) eating the world, everyone’s asking the mirror-mirror-on-the-wall question: “Which model is the most utilized of them all?” Let’s unpack what we’ve seen.\\\\n\\\\n### Top LLM providers\\\\n\\\\nLike [last year’s results](https://www.blog.langchain.com/langchain-state-of-ai-2023/), **OpenAI** reigns as the most used LLM provider among LangSmith users —\\xa0used more than 6x as much as Ollama, the next-most popular provider (counted by LangSmith organization usage).\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/Top-10-LLM-Providers-bar-chart.png)\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, **Ollama** and **Groq** (which both allow users to run open source models, with the former focusing on local execution and the latter on cloud deployment) have accelerated in momentum this year, breaking into the top 5. This shows a growing interest in more flexible deployment options and customizable AI infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/Top-10-LLM-Providers-leaderboard--1-.png)\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to providers that offer open-source models, the top providers have stayed relatively consistent compared to last year - Ollama, Mistral, and Hugging Face have made it easy for developers to run open source models on their platforms. These OSS providers’ collective usage represents **20%** of the top 20 LLM providers (by the number of organizations using them).\\\\n\\\\n### Top Retrievers / Vector Stores\\\\n\\\\nPerforming retrieval is still critical for many GenAI workflows. The top 3 vector stores have remained the same as last year, with Chroma and FAISS as the most popular choices. This year, Milvus, MongoDB, and Elastic’s vector databases have also entered the top 10.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/Top-10-Retrievers--1-.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Building with LangChain products\\\\n\\\\nAs developers have gained more experience utilizing generative AI, they are also building more dynamic applications. From the growing sophistication of workflows, to the rise of AI agents — we’re seeing a few trends that point to an evolving ecosystem of innovation.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/Chart-3c---990x742-px--1-.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Observability isn’t limited to LangChain applications\\\\n\\\\nWhile `langchain` (our open source framework) is central to many folks’ LLM app development journeys, **15.7%** of LangSmith traces this year come from **non-`langchain`** frameworks. This reflects a broader trend where observability is needed regardless of what framework you’re using to build the LLM app — and that interoperability is supported by LangSmith.\\\\n\\\\n`langchain`\\\\n`langchain`\\\\n\\\\n### Python remains dominant, while JavaScript usage grows\\\\n\\\\nDebugging, testing, and monitoring certainly has a special place in our Python developers’ hearts, with 84.7% usage coming from the Python SDK. But there is a notable and growing interest in JavaScript as developers pursue web-first applications —\\xa0the JavaScript SDK accounts for 15.3% of LangSmith usage this year, increasing 3x compared to the previous year.\\\\n\\\\n### AI agents are gaining traction\\\\n\\\\nAs companies are getting more serious about [incorporating AI agents across various industries](https://www.langchain.com/stateofaiagents?ref=blog.langchain.com), adoption of our controllable agent framework, LangGraph, is also on the rise. Since its release in March 2024, LangGraph has steadily gained traction —\\xa0with **43%** of LangSmith organizations are now **sending LangGraph traces**. These traces represent complex, orchestrated tasks that go beyond basic LLM interactions.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/--sending-LangGraph-traces--2--1.png)\\\\n\\\\nThis growth aligns with the rise in agentic behavior: we see that on average **21.9% of traces now involve tool calls,** up from an average of 0.5% in 2023. Tool calling allows a model to autonomously invoke functions or external resources, signaling more agentic behavior where the model decides when to take action. Increased use of tool calling can enhance an agent’s ability to interact with external systems and perform tasks like writing to databases.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/--of-tool-calls--revised-.png)\\\\n\\\\n## Performance and optimization\\\\n\\\\nBalancing speed and sophistication is a key challenge when developing applications — especially those leveraging LLM resources. Below, we explore how organizations are interacting with their applications to align the complexity of their needs with efficient performance.\\\\n\\\\n### Complexity is growing, but tasks are being handled efficiently\\\\n\\\\nThe average number of steps per trace has more than doubled over the past year, **rising** from **on** **average 2.8 steps (2023) to 7.7 steps (2024).** We define a step as a distinct operation within a trace, such as a call to an LLM, retriever, or tool. This growth in steps signals that organizations are leveraging more complex and multi-faceted workflows. Rather than a simple question-answer interaction, users are building systems that chain together multiple tasks, such as retrieving information, processing it, and generating actionable results.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/average---of-steps--revised---1-.png)\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast, the average number of LLM calls per trace has grown more modestly— from **on average 1.1 to 1.4 LLM calls.** This speaks to how developers are designing systems to achieve more with fewer LLM calls, balancing functionality while keeping expensive LLM requests in check\\\\n\\\\n## LLM testing & evaluation\\\\n\\\\nWhat are organizations doing to test their LLM applications to guard against inaccurate or low-quality LLM-generated responses? While it’s no easy feat to [keep the quality of your LLM app high](https://www.langchain.com/testing-guide-ebook?ref=blog.langchain.com), we see organizations using LangSmith’s evaluation capabilities to automate testing and generate user feedback loops to create more robust, reliable applications.\\\\n\\\\n### LLM-as-Judge: Evaluating what matters\\\\n\\\\nLLM-as-Judge evaluators capture grading rules into an LLM prompt and use the LLM to score whether the output adheres to specific criteria. We see developers testing for these characteristics the most: **Relevance**, **Correctness**, **Exact Match**, and **Helpfulness**\\\\n\\\\nThese highlight that most developers are doing coarse checks for response quality to make sure AI generated outputs don’t completely miss the mark.\\\\n\\\\n![](https://www.blog.langchain.com/content/images/2024/12/Top-evaluation-metrics--1-.png)\\\\n\\\\n### Iterating with human feedback\\\\n\\\\nHuman feedback is a key part of the iteration loop for folks building LLM apps. LangSmith speeds up the process of [collecting and incorporating human feedback](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/how_to_guides?ref=blog.langchain.com#annotation-queues-and-human-feedback) on traces and runs (i.e. spans) – so that users can create rich datasets for improvement and optimization. Over the past year, annotated runs grew **18x**, scaling linearly with growth in LangSmith usage.\\\\n\\\\nFeedback volume per run also increased slightly, rising from **2.28 to 2.59 feedback entries per run**. Still, feedback is relatively sparse per run. Users may be prioritizing speed in reviewing runs over providing comprehensive feedback, or commenting on only the most critical or problematic runs that need attention.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nIn 2024, developers leaned into complexity with multi-step agents, sharpened efficiency by doing more with fewer LLM calls, and added quality checks to their apps using methods of feedback and evaluation. As more LLM apps are created, we’re excited to see how folks dig into smarter workflows, better performance, and stronger reliability.\\\\n\\\\n[Learn more here](https://langchain.com/langsmith?ref=blog.langchain.com) about how LangSmith can bring more visibility into your LLM app development and improve performance over time —\\xa0from debugging bottlenecks to evaluating response quality to monitoring regressions.\\\\n\\\\n### Tags\\\\n\\\\n### Join our newsletter\\\\n\\\\nUpdates from the LangChain team and community\\\\n\\\\nProcessing your application...\\\\n\\\\nSuccess!

Common examples of these types of applications include:\\\\n\\\\n**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**\\\\n\\\\n[Documentation](./use_cases/question_answering.html)\\\\n\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: [Question Answering over Notion Database](https://github.com/hwchase17/notion-qa)\\\\n\\\\n**💬 Chatbots**\\\\n\\\\n[Documentation](./use_cases/chatbots.html)\\\\n\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: [Chat-LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain)\\\\n\\\\n**🤖 Agents**\\\\n\\\\n[Documentation](./use_cases/agents.html)\\\\n\\\\nEnd-to-end Example: [GPT+WolframAlpha](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JavaFXpert/Chat-GPT-LangChain)\\\\n\\\\n## Getting Started[#](#getting-started \\\\\"Permalink to this headline\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\\\n\\\\n[Getting Started Documentation](./getting_started/getting_started.html)\\\\n\\\\n## Modules[#](#modules \\\\\"Permalink to this headline\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\\\n\\\\n[Prompts](./modules/prompts.html): This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\\\n\\\\n[LLMs](./modules/llms.html): This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\\\n\\\\n[Document Loaders](./modules/document_loaders.html): This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\\\n\\\\n[Utils](./modules/utils.html): Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\\\n\\\\n[Chains](./modules/chains.html): Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\\\n\\\\n[Indexes](./modules/indexes.html): Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\\\n\\\\n[Agents](./modules/agents.html): Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\\\n\\\\n[Memory](./modules/memory.html): Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\\\n\\\\n[Chat](./modules/chat.html): Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\\\n\\\\n## Use Cases[#](#use-cases \\\\\"Permalink to this headline\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\\\n\\\\n[Agents](./use_cases/agents.html): Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\\\n\\\\n[Chatbots](./use_cases/chatbots.html): Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\\\n\\\\n[Data Augmented Generation](./use_cases/combine_docs.html): Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\\\n\\\\n[Question Answering](./use_cases/question_answering.html): Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\n\\\\n[Summarization](./use_cases/summarization.html): Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\\\n\\\\n[Evaluation](./use_cases/evaluation.html): Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\n\\\\n[Generate similar examples](./use_cases/generate_examples.html): Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\\\n\\\\n[Compare models](./use_cases/model_laboratory.html): Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\\\n\\\\n## Reference Docs[#](#reference-docs \\\\\"Permalink to this headline\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place.
